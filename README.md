# News Sentimental Scoring with Vader and Stock Price Pivot Points with matplotlib and mplfinance

----

On every run, the .ipynb notebook will perform a sentimental analysis on the latest top n number of news of a chosen stock ticker and will calculate the pivot points, printing it out in a graph.

Limitations:
* Can be hosted to give true live real time output for better decision making
* Vader model can be finetuned to financial news/dataset just like in the project _US-Federal_Reserve-Statement-NLP-Summarizer_ to output optimal compound score
